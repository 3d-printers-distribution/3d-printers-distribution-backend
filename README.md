# Distributing 3D Printings to Demands Backend

## Goal
This project provides the backend structure and model for the Distribution of 3D Printings project.
The project was created during the non-profit hackathon #CodeVsCovid19 created by HackZurich.

We try to match the 3d printers producing masks and other useful articles to the correct places. 
The hardest part is matching the distributors (e.g. firemen) to pick up the goods at the right place and where to bring 
them.
